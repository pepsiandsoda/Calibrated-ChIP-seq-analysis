# Calibrated-ChIP-seq-analysis
A bioinformatics tool for analysing S. cerevisiae cailbrated ChIP-seq data. Calibrated ChIP-seq data can be analysed across many different genomic features including centromeres, entire chromosomes, autonomously replicating seqeunces, open reading frames, convergent and divergent gene pairs, pericentromeric borders, start and stop codons, and tRNA genes. 

The jupyter notebook shows examples plots made using chromosomes I and III for 0, 15 and 30 minutes after G1 Î±-factor release. Data was reanalysed from Hu et al. 2015.

The files containing positions and other information for chromosome features that are needed to run the script are included.
