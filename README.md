# Calibrated-ChIP-seq-analysis
A bioinformatics tool for analysing S. cerevisiae cailbrated ChIP-seq data. Calibrated ChIP-seq data can be analysed across many different genomic features including centromeres, entire chromosomes, autonomously replicating seqeunces, open reading frames, convergent and divergent gene pairs, pericentromeric borders, start and stop codons, and tRNA genes.
